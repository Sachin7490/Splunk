Splunk comprises several key components that work together to collect, index, search, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data. These components are brodly classified into two parts such as Processing Components and Management Components.

Processing Components: Responsible to collect, store and process the data.

1. **Forwarders**:
   - **Universal Forwarder**: A lightweight version of Splunk that collects data from various sources and forwards it to the Splunk Indexer. Itâ€™s designed for minimal resource usage.
   - **Heavy Forwarder**: Ae an full instance of Splunk that can parsd index data before forwarding it to the Indexer. It is used when more complex processing or filtering of data is required at the source.

2. **Indexers**:
   - **Indexers**: These are the components responsible for storing and indexing the incoming data. They also perform search operations on the indexed data in response to search requests from the Search Heads. Indexers can be clustered for high availability and scalability.

3. **Search Heads**:
   - **Search Heads**: These components handle search requests from users. They distribute search queries to Indexers and aggregate the results. Search Heads can be clustered to handle large numbers of concurrent searches and to provide high availability.
  
Management Components: Responsible to manage overall splunk operations.

4. **Deployment Server**:
   - **Deployment Server**: Used for managing and distributing configurations, apps, and updates to other Splunk components, particularly Forwarders. It simplifies the management of large-scale Splunk deployments.

5. **Cluster Master (Master Node)**:
   - **Cluster Master**: Manages and coordinates the activities of Indexer clusters, ensuring data is replicated and distributed properly for high availability and disaster recovery.

6. **License Master**:
   - **License Master**: Manages Splunk license usage and ensures compliance with the licensed data volume. It monitors the data ingestion rate and provides alerts if the usage exceeds the licensed limits.

7. **Deployer**:
   - **Deployer**: Used for distributing configuration and app updates to Search Head clusters. It ensures that all Search Heads in a cluster have consistent configurations.

These components together form the comprehensive Splunk platform, enabling users to collect, process, analyze, and visualize data from diverse sources for a wide range of applications.

Splunk Data Pipeline.

![Splunk Data Pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ba6dcc-9fb1-4e5e-a6ff-52419779a332)

The Splunk data pipeline refers to the process through which data flows from the moment it is ingested into Splunk until it is indexed and made available for search and analysis. The pipeline is divided into several stages, each responsible for a specific set of tasks. Here is an overview of the Splunk data pipeline:

1. Data Input (Ingestion)
Data Collection: Data is collected from various sources using different input methods, such as forwarders, scripted inputs, HTTP Event Collectors (HEC), and monitoring files.
Forwarders: Universal Forwarders and Heavy Forwarders send data to Splunk Indexers. Universal Forwarders are lightweight and primarily forward raw data, while Heavy Forwarders can preprocess data before forwarding it.
2. Parsing (Event Processing)
Breaking the Data into Events: During this stage, Splunk breaks the raw data into individual events based on predefined or custom delimiters (such as newline characters or timestamps).
Timestamp Extraction: Splunk extracts timestamps from the data, which are critical for indexing and searching.
Metadata Addition: Metadata, such as the source, host, and sourcetype, is added to each event.
3. Indexing
Indexing Data: Events are indexed, which involves transforming the raw data into a format suitable for fast searching. This process includes tokenization and the creation of index files.
Storage: Indexed data is stored in index buckets, which are organized into directories on disk. Indexes are divided into hot, warm, cold, and frozen stages based on the age of the data.
4. Search (Query Execution)
Search Processing Language (SPL): Users query the indexed data using Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL).
Search Head: Distributes search requests across multiple Indexers, aggregates the results, and presents them to the user.
Real-time and Historical Searches: Splunk supports both real-time searches (continuously updated results) and historical searches (based on previously indexed data).
